# Returning to ICFP

## Verse 1

[Compiling with Continuations, or without?
Whatever.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3341643)

Compiling programs in CPS or not\
We all need some form of continuations.\
They never return as regular functions\
Nor do they escape their defining scope.

## Verse 2

## Verse 3

[Refinement Types for Haskell](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2628136.2628161)

Refinement type system designed for Haskell\
Type checking using an SMT solver\
Soundness is hard due to lazy semantics\
We must know which binders do not terminate

## Verse 4 (Bridge)

[Synthesizing Structured CAD Models with Equality Saturation and Inverse
Transformations](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~cnandi/docs/pldi20-cr.pdf)

[John]\
how an E-graph can compactly\
applying rewrites\
affine signature of each eclass as the\
slightly perturbed Caddy

[Youyou]\
When I wish to synthesize code\
for 3D printing\
(I) simply apply an inverse transformation\
And then I get what I want

[Chandra (verse rather than bridge)]\
Egraphs and rewrites for program synthesis
Finding folds and maps from long flat Caddys
Dynamic patterns come to the rescue
Inverse transformations fight AC matching

[Proposal]\
Egraphs, rewrites for synthesis (4 + 4)\
folds [or maps] from flat Caddys (5)\
Dynamic patterns come to the rescue us- (11)\
ing inverse transformations (7)

## Chorus

Monad transformers and macros and handlers\
Tuples and presheaves and posets and closures\
Liftings and joins and commutative rings.\
These are a few of my favorite things.
