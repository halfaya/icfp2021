# Returning to ICFP

## Verse 1

[Compiling with Continuations, or without?
Whatever.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3341643)

Compiling programs in CPS or not\
We all need some form of continuations.\
They never return as regular functions\
Nor do they escape their defining scope.

## Verse 2

## Verse 3

[Refinement Types for Haskell](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2628136.2628161)

Refinement type system designed for Haskell\
Type checking using an SMT solver\
Soundness is hard due to lazy semantics\
We must know which binders do not terminate

## Verse 4 (Bridge)

[Synthesizing Structured CAD Models with Equality Saturation and Inverse
Transformations](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~cnandi/docs/pldi20-cr.pdf)

Egraphs, rewrites for synthesis\
folds from flat Caddys\
Dynamic patterns come to the rescue us-\
ing inverse transformations

## Chorus

Monad transformers and macros and handlers\
Tuples and presheaves and posets and closures\
Liftings and joins and commutative rings.\
These are a few of my favorite things.
