# Returning to ICFP

## Verse 1

[Compiling with Continuations, or without?
Whatever.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3341643)

Compiling programs in CPS or not\
We all need some form of continuations.\
They never return as regular functions\
Nor do they escape their defining scope.

## Verse 2

[Refinement Types for Haskell](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2628136.2628161)

Encoding invariants using refinements\
How can we check them with lazy semantics?\
We don't know which binders do not terminate\
Unless we label them explicitly.

## Verse 3

## Verse 4 (Bridge)

[Synthesizing Structured CAD Models with Equality Saturation and Inverse
Transformations](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~cnandi/docs/pldi20-cr.pdf)

how an E-graph can compactly\
applying rewrites\
affine signature of each eclass as the\
slightly perturbed Caddy

When I wish to synthesize code\
for 3D printing\
(I) simply apply an inverse transformation\
And then I get what I want

## Chorus

Monads and XX and XX and XX\
XX and presheaves and XX and XX\
XX and X and commutative rings.\
These are a few of my favorite things.
