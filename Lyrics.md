## Verse 1

[Compiling with Continuations, or without?
Whatever.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3341643)

Compiling programs in CPS or not\
We all need some form of continuations.\
They never return as regular functions\
Nor do they escape their defining scope.

XX and XX and XX and XX\
XX and XX and XX and X\
These are a few of my favorite things.
