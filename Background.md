ICFP 2021 Video\
**Our Favorite Things**\
Background

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzcMpLkkCrc) was a
collaborabration between Youyou Cong and John Leo, with the help of
many other [people](Credits.md). We had worked together on the [ICFP
2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fte5wwnwCws) video, and Youyou
suggested doing something new for ICFP 2021. The initial idea was to
do another song parody as in the previous video and the two for [PLDI
2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMCl64Uhe8) and [PLDI
2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77999Td20TM). However the great
[POPL 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=707tBQ07I-A) video
inspired us to create something different with a plot. We had already
considered a
[micro-opera](https://github.com/halfaya/icfp2020/tree/master/opera)
for the 2020 video, and the story of this one connects both to that
and the POPL video.

We used the song we were planning to write a parody to, *My Favorite
Things* from *The Sound of Music*. In addition, since the conference
was originally to be in Korea, we incorporated some traditional Korean
percussion. John had performed in the Music of Korea ensemble while a
grad student at UCLA, so we incorporated the rhythm of a brief section
of the [samulnori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samul_nori) work
[Buksori II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Jh6m3ZXFk) by Dong Suk
Kim, which John had performed (on buk) under the direction of the
composer.

Below are some of our thoughts as we created the video. We've
intentionally left the interpretation up to the viewer, so if you'd
prefer to not be influenced by our own perspective then read no
further!

The basic idea is that as the pandemic is coming to an end, four
researchers in different parts of the world return to their offices
after a long absence, searching for "favorite things" to bring to
ICFP. Although the conference is still virtual, there is a sense of
hope that life is starting to return to normal. Concretely the favorite
things are specific papers they have authored, each corresponding to a
letter in ICFP. However what they are really bringing is themselves,
their background and expertise, and their collaboration with other
researchers.

We sent instructions to the actors with basic guidelines but offered a
lot of freedom in the details, and were rewarded with many beautiful
artistic touches in each of the segments, as can easily be appreciated
in the final video.

The lyrics were written by the actors following the rhythm of the
song, and are meant to represent thoughts going through their heads as
they search for the paper. The Korean percussion can be thought of as
the "voice" of ICFP calling each person back to the conference. Each
individual segment uses a different instrument of the samulnori, while
the chorus combines all of them.

The final chorus is intended to be a celebration of the conference
itself. It ends deliberately on a half cadence; if you want the final
cadence you'll have attend the conference yourself!
